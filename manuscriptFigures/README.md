# Reproduce MLcps Manuscript Figures

This repository contains the necessary code to reproduce the figures presented in the MLcps manuscript.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Folder Structure

- `results.zip`: Contains the necessary data for generating the figures.
- `plots.html`: Rendered Jupyter notebook with Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure S4.
- `spyder.html`: Rendered Jupyter notebook with additional supplementary figures.
- `plots.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for reproducing Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure S4.
- `spyder.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for reproducing additional supplementary figures.

## Instructions

### 1. Accessing the Results

All the results are provided in a zipped folder named `results.zip`. Extract this folder to access the necessary data for reproducing the figures.

### 2. Reproducing the Figures

To regenerate Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure S4, use the Python notebook called `plots.ipynb`. Open this notebook and run the code to recreate these specific figures.

### 3. Additional Figures

To regenerate Figure S1, Figure S2, and Figure S3, open the `spyder.ipynb` notebook and run the code to recreate these additional figures.
